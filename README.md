My preferred note type for mining in Migaku. The styling is based off the [Lapis](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis) notetype as I use this in every other situation but retains the functionality
I care about from [Migaku's](https://github.com/migaku-official/Migaku-Japanese-Addon) default note type.

E.g.  所\[ところ;h\] still shows the pitch accent and furigana on hover.
