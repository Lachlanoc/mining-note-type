My preferred note type for mining in Migaku. The styling is based off the [Lapis](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis) notetype as I use this in every other situation but retains the functionality
I care about from [Migaku's](https://github.com/migaku-official/Migaku-Japanese-Addon) default note type.

E.g.  所\[ところ;h\] still shows the pitch accent and furigana on hover.

Target word highlighting on the frontside sentence only works for the base of the word as Migaku provides a normalised form of verbs in its target word field. It's not ideal but the visibility is still good.

The code was primarily generated with Gemini 3 Pro.

Fields include:
```
Sentence
Translation
Target Word
Definitions
Screenshot
Sentence Audio
Word Audio
Images
Example Sentences
IsSentenceCard
IsWordAndSentenceCard
Notes
```


In Migaku I have the fields mapped to:
